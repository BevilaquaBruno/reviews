How did we get to where we are today?

This second installment is a summary of the history of various institutions in Brazil, in different areas, addressing cases such as EMBRAPA, PETROBRÁS, and even specific ministries or foundations for education, sanitation, etc.

Personally, I note that much of what is followed as standard today, for better or worse, emerged in the new state, under Getúlio Vargas. For the most part, the summary is honest, highlighting the positive and negative aspects of all the public policies implemented during the various administrations we have had.

Great book if you want a summary and background on Brazil's institutions.
